One thousand years before the start of the novel, the prophesied Hero of Ages ascended to godhood at the Well of Ascension in order to repel the Deepness, a terror threatening the world whose true nature has been lost to time. Though the Deepness was successfully repelled and mankind saved, the world was changed into its current form by the Hero, who took the title "Lord Ruler" and ruled over the Final Empire for a thousand years, as an immortal tyrant and god. Under his rule, society is stratified into the nobility, believed to be the descendants of the friends who helped him achieve godhood; and brutally oppressed peasantry, known as skaa.

Magic is central to the Mistborn world. The most widely known discipline of magic is called Allomancy, which allows users to gain magical powers by swallowing and "burning" specific metals to gain supernatural abilities. Allomantic potential is a genetic trait concentrated in the nobility, though skaa Allomancers exist, due to crossbreeding between the nobility and the skaa. Normal Allomancers have access to one Allomantic power, but an incredibly rare subset of Allomancers, called Mistborn, have access to every Allomantic power.');


INSERT INTO post (title, body) VALUES ('Mistborn: The Well of Ascension ','The Final Empire is in turmoil, with various regions descending into anarchy after the Lord Rulers death and the disappearance of the Steel Ministry, the Final Empires religious and government body. Elend Venture immediately claims the crown of the capital city, Luthadel, and attempts to restore order, but various nobles converge to take the city for themselves.

Three armies lay siege to Luthadel because of its rumored wealth of Atium and political influence. The first army is led by Straff Venture–head of Luthadels House Venture, and Elends father–who is intent on ruling Luthadel and The Final Empire. The second army is led by Ashweather Cett, one of the many who have declared themselves as Kings of the various provinces. The third army consists of Koloss, creatures similar in form to humans but with bodies that keep growing until their hearts can no longer support their size, led by Elends former friend Jastes–who is buying the Koloss obedience with counterfeit coins.

Vin, Elend and Kelsiers crew are the only ones who know that the Lord Ruler had been a Terrisman with Feruchemical and Allomantic abilities that allowed the Lord Ruler to create an illusion of mythical powers and immortality. After foiling various assassination attempts, they surmise that a Kandra impostor has taken the form and identity of one of Kelsiers crew, to spy on their strategies.

Vin becomes suspicious of the mists, while Sazed has come across suspicious deaths that appear to be caused by the mists. Sazed is tracked down by Marsh–Kelsiers brother and a Steel Inquisitor–to accompany him to a Ministry stronghold called "The Conventical of Seran", where the Steel Inquisitors and High Obligators of the Lord Rulers religion had retreated after the Collapse. They discover that the Steel Inquisitors and High Obligators murdered all of their servants at the Conventical; they also find a Terris journal engraved into steel that was authored by the Terrisman who had claimed that Alendi was the Hero of Ages');

INSERT INTO post (title , body) VALUES ('Mistborn: The Hero of Ages' , 'The Hero of Ages is the prophesied savior of the Terris people, foretold to find and give up the power at the Well of Ascension, in a selfless act to save the world from the Deepness. However, the Terris prophecies proved to be altered, in a ruse intended to allow escape from imprisonment, by a force named Ruin that wants the complete destruction of the world.

A mist spirit trying to help Vin and Sazed find the truth of the twisted prophecy, attempts to make Vin keep the power from the Well, by deliberately wounding Elend, but believing in the prophecy, she releases it instead of saving Elend. In the Chamber of Ascension were once nuggets of pure Allomancy, the power of Preservation itself, fractions of the power in the Well, which changes those who ingest them into Mistborn. With no power to save the dying Elend, Vin is convinced by the mist spirit to give a remaining bead of Preservation to Elend.

Ruin wanted the world to be destroyed in the blink of an eye but his power was too weakened by his body having been taken and hidden by Preservation. Ruin became obsessed with finding his hidden body. Freedom from the Well of Ascension enabled Ruin to directly affect the world more, with the most destructive results in the form of increased ashfall from the ashmounts and growing earthquakes breaking the world apart; Ruin focused most of his energy in the last days to geological decay, while also influencing more people and controlling entire koloss armies. He used his thousand years of imprisonment to strategize the timing of the Lord Rulers downfall to occur when Preservations power returned to the Well of Ascension, followed by his being freed a few years later');
